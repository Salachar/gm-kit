What I was working on:
    - Cleaning up the text input modals

    - Changing the info amount buttons into an input

    - Changing the volume slider to something less ugly

    - Readd/fix being able to delete tags
        - Initial tags are missing the remove button

    - Fix up checkboxes to match standard 3rem header/input size
        - Fix up the checkboxes in the map list modal, they are too easy to click outside of

    - Fix the positions of the help and text_block nodes

    - Change the style of the info buttons

    - Re-enable saving of info results
        - Change the verbage, "marked" sounds better and people won't think it saves like the map does

    - Lights need to update after changing
        - Perhaps add an interval to update the lights

    - Lights need a way to display power status

    - Lights need a color picker in order to change them
        - Scenes will not be changable

    - Add basic trigger functionality
        - Will require being able to get all data from both the Audio and Lights containers/managers

    - Fix the UI for the Text Blocks so that it meshes more with the container header
        - Currently it looks too much like a modal that you can't move, which is misleading

    - variables.css could probably use a little bit of cleanup

    - HTTP helper should be added to generic helpers and have hardcoded bullshit removed


TODO:
    - Add small mirrored map/image display for players on the other side of the table
        - Optional, not always shown
        - I can make it a checkbox or some stupid shit

    - Add "Enemy Markers" to the board
        - Just a name and number
        - Movable as enemies move as well
        - Small input for entering damage/health
        - Plus/Minus toggle

    - Add super basic dice rolling capabilities

    - Shape/Marker creation for items on the map
        - Try to make it easy to use for spells and shit

    - Update the info generator buttons to not look like shit

    - Fix one way wall indicator to better show which side is see through
        - A big arrow going through the wall showing direction of light passage should work

    - Look at the help text again, I don't think it's very good

    - Load state should show a Toast error if there is no map loaded

    - Load state might not even work in general

    - Take another look at the store and see if it works for general use
        - It might be the best way that I can share the Audio and Lights data

    - map display.js file needs to be moved into the map container folder

    - Sound and Quadrant managers should be moved off the AppManager
        - SoundManager is misleading given that the audio app has been added
        - QuadrantManager is specific only to maps and nothing else needs it

    - Move everything over to github
        - Had support for Electron updating
        - Owned by Microsoft and just kinda better in general from what I can tell

    - I need a better name for this stupid app

    - Add functionaliy similar to map folder picking for audio

    - Lights needs input in the header to enter your LIFX code
        - Currently hardcoded in the http helper
        - lifxaccess file does nothing at all
        - LIFX code should display in the header and save to the main config
        - Remove specific file for LIFX access code
        - Add a small info bit saying the code is not sent anywhere and only saved to a
            file on the machine
        - Link to github and files for people who want to verify it for themselves

    - Look into adding better touch support
        - Touch works pretty for maps but there are some bad quirks with it that prevent touch
            only use for wall placement

    - Re-add arrow key scrolling
        - Sometimes it just seems better
        - The scrollers were complete garbage though

    - Add menu controls, there should be a button for everything
        - Menu should be hidable
        - Readd scrolling from DM window

    - Leaving focus of app can at times cause it to become stuck in point moving mode

    - Add Grid

    - When connecting between two existing segments, there should be no length check
        - Maybe disbale for shift clicking in general
        - Or even altogether at this point
        - Dont allow snapping to origin point

    - Add ability to add text to locations
        - Question Mark icon
        - Click to Open, Click outside to close
        - Should be able to save individually
            - Or at least would be nice to

    - Build Process
        - Get building for both windows and mac, no installation required
        - Look into how the updates work (does it require a proper installer or not)
        - Look into hosting builds
            - Probably will be from my main site
        - Look into switching to Github
            - Can use a .io page for the main page easily
            - Can probably host from this page as well

    - Option to disable walls for a map, so everything is lit up

    - Create a campaign (basically a folder with links)
        - Somehow add maps to a campaign

    - Read in config

    - Attempt to fetch images from a PDF

    - Add map sources link:
        - This can just be a stupid little like the help node
        - I can a button like "Community Maps" or something

Old Electron Builder code, for when I decide to try that bullshit again
"build": {

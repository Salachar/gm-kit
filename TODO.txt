Updates (4/23/2018):
    - Arrow Key Scrolling:
        Selected window will now scroll with the arrow keys
    - Edge Hover Scrolling:
        Hover over the edge of the map to scroll in that direction
    - Secondary Window scrolling using Main Window:
        Holding 'ALT' and doing one of the above scrolling methods
        on the Main Window will scroll the Secondary Window
    - One second delay to edge hovering
        To prevent unwanted edge hovering when moving out of the map area
        the user must stay on the hover location for one second before scrolling
        will start
    - Map Dir Creation:
        If the maps directory location doesn't exist, which should be
        located next to the executable, one will now be created
    - Map Dir Location Info:
        On the map selection modal, there is no an info icon, hovering over
        this will tell you where the maps directory is located on your
        machine
    - Improved Lighting Performance on Secondary Display
    - Improved section titles on the map select modal

Updates (5/1/2018):
    - Added One Way Walls for elevation purposes
    - Added example map

Updates (5/3/2018):
    - Added a README to help showcase the application

Updates (7/9/2018):
    - Sanitize map data on save
        - Remove length for segments *not needed
            - only needed for door dragging, computed on runtime now
        - Round all segments to whole integer *floats not needed
        - Remove light links, not needed in dual map setup
    - Remove Light Links
        - There are not needed for the dual window application and are legacy
    - Whole integers for segment x/y, I can't see why rounding to the nearest whole hurts
        anything and would reduce .json file size (not important) and payload of light data
        to the secondary screen (more important)

Updates (10/5/2018)
    - Added new event/store implementation
    - Holding CTRL now lets the user drag ends of placed walls
    - Image auto sizing added in, new max of 3000 pixels
    - Hide scrolling elements when at the edge of the map

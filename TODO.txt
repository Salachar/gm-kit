TODO:
    - One way walls, for elevation
    - Wall end dragging
    - Map moving with middle or right mouse click and drag
    - Option to see light on display window
    - Read in config is present
    - Let user specify map directory
        - Gets written to config

Look Into:
    - Removing length from wall information, as it is not used
        - Will need to be removed/added based on toggling walls/doors
    - Remove Light Links
        - There are not needed for the dual window application and are legacy
    - Whole integers for segment x/y, I can't see why rounding to the nearest whole hurts
        anything and would reduce .json file size (not important) and payload of light data
        to the secondary screen (more important)

Updates (4/23/2018):
    - Arrow Key Scrolling:
        Selected window will now scroll with the arrow keys
    - Edge Hover Scrolling:
        Hover over the edge of the map to scroll in that direction
    - Secondary Window scrolling using Main Window:
        Holding 'ALT' and doing one of the above scrolling methods
        on the Main Window will scroll the Secondary Window
    - One second delay to edge hovering
        To prevent unwanted edge hovering when moving out of the map area
        the user must stay on the hover location for one second before scrolling
        will start
    - Map Dir Creation:
        If the maps directory location doesn't exist, which should be
        located next to the executable, one will now be created
    - Map Dir Location Info:
        On the map selection modal, there is no an info icon, hovering over
        this will tell you where the maps directory is located on your
        machine
    - Improved Lighting Performance on Secondary Display
    - Improved section titles on the map select modal

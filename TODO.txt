What I was working on:
    - Add menu controls, there should be a button for most things
        - Menu should be hidable
        - Re-add arrow key scrolling
            - Sometimes it just seems better
            - The scrollers were complete garbage though
        - Add Grid
        - Switching maps needs to update the controls
            - grid values

    - The same wall segment can be added multiple times

    - Lights need a color picker in order to change them
        - Scenes will not be changable

    - Add functionaliy similar to map folder picking for audio

    - Lights helpful info
        - Lights should also have a better "default" page when there are no lights
        - Add a small info bit saying the code is not sent anywhere and only saved to a
            file on the machine
        - Link to github and files for people who want to verify it for themselves

    - Sending lights data to the Player Screen needs to be cleaned up a bit.
        - Feels really hackish at the moment

    - When connecting between two existing segments, there should be no length check
        - Maybe disbale for shift clicking in general
        - Or even altogether at this point
        - Dont allow snapping to origin point

    - Move one way wall checkbox to the controls


TODO:
    - Opening/Closing doors after they have been cracked open
        - Need a way to show door on player screen

    - Saving/Loading state:
        - Currently, the state is read from the GM screen, which is not great, since I dont always run it in lighting mode.
        - Fog/Light states need to be read from the Player Screen
        - Load state should show a Toast error if there is no map loaded
        - Load state might not even work in general

    - PDF reading for map and room information
        - DC checks and shit like that

    - Add "Triggers"
        - Will require being able to get all data from both the Audio and Lights containers/managers
        - A trigger is a selection of lights, color, and music
        - When activated, the selected lights (or scenes) will change color to the selected color and the music will play
        - Multiple colors per trigger are not allowed
            - Complex light effects should be put into a scene beforehand in the LIFX app (public APIs dont allow scene creation right now)
            - The color option is mandatory

    - Add small mirrored map/image display for players on the other side of the table
        - Optional, not always shown
        - I can make it a checkbox or some stupid shit

    - Add "Enemy Markers" to the board
        - Just a name and number
        - Movable as enemies move as well
        - Small input for entering damage/health
        - Plus/Minus toggle

        - Shape/Marker creation for items on the map
            - Try to make it easy to use for spells and shit

    - Add super basic dice rolling capabilities

    - Sound and Quadrant managers should be moved off the AppManager
        - SoundManager is misleading given that the audio app has been added
        - QuadrantManager is specific only to maps and nothing else needs it

    - Look into adding better touch support
        - Touch works pretty for maps but there are some bad quirks with it that prevent touch
            only use for wall placement

    - Build Process
        - Get building for both windows and mac, no installation required
        - Look into how the updates work (does it require a proper installer or not)
        - Look into hosting builds
            - Probably will be from my main site
        - Look into switching to Github
            - Can use a .io page for the main page easily
            - Can probably host from this page as well

    - Create a campaign (basically a folder with links)
        - Somehow add maps to a campaign

    - Attempt to fetch images from a PDF

    - Add map sources link:
        - This can just be a stupid little like the help node
        - I can a button like "Community Maps" or something

Update (9/14/2019):
    - Added UI Scale input to the app, still needs a label
    - When a wall start when snapped to the middle of a line, it does not split the segment being snapped to
        - This no longer seems to be happening, at least I can't reproduce it anymore
    - Rename "move_segment" shit to "move_point" or something
        - Renamed to "move_mode"
    - Why the fuck does the SegmentManager also have its own pointDistance function
        - Removed and using pDistance from helpers
    - Fixed issue where segments were trying to be split when only an endpoint matched
        - This was causing issues with one way walls triggering new normals and shit
    - connected_segments tracking for moving was removed, it was broken and is cleaner without it
        - Cost is performance during wall/point moving, which is not as important


Update (9/7/2019):
    - After all maps are removed, the controls toggle no longer works
        - All events were being cleared, even onces not tied to keys, which we want to keep
        - After the last map is removed, only the key and keyEvents are now cleared
    - Move one way wall checkbox to the controls
        - It doesn't belong there, only Player Screen related things do
        - I did update the label, could still be a little cleaner
    - Lighting now updates properly for point moving and one way placement
    - The same wall segment can be added multiple times
        - Added checks for matching segments before adding
    - Add menu controls, there should be a button for most things
        - Menu should be hidable
    - Sending lights data to the Player Screen needs to be cleaned up a bit.
        - Feels really hackish at the moment
        - This is much better with the new player screen event system
    - When connecting between two existing segments, there should be no length check
        - Maybe disbale for shift clicking in general
        - Or even altogether at this point
        - Dont allow snapping to origin point
        - No snapping is allowed to origin points or the segments it shares
    - Move HELP button to the left side
        - Also moved the help box to the left and gave it a little padding


Update (9/6/2019):
    - Overlay grids are now saved when the map is saved
    - mousedown on the arrow and number inputs now keeps going, as opposed to individual clicks
        - timer for handler killed by mouseup and mouseleave
    - Changing the volume slider to something less ugly
        - Will use the number input when its
    - all _(ps) events are sent to the main and player screen without needing to approve it
        - all _(PS) events are sent only to the player screen
        - display_window_events map removed from store.js
        - I can re-add alt events at some point, but I might just make the controls the only way for some of them
    - Add menu controls, there should be a button for most things
        - Re-add arrow key scrolling
            - Sometimes it just seems better
            - The scrollers were complete garbage though
        - Add Grid
        - Switching maps needs to update the controls
            - grid values
            - zoom
            - brightness


Update (9/5/2019):
    - Calling delete on a segment with a one way wall will delete the one way wall info and redraw appropriately
    - Fixed drawing the light on the maps
        - You can't do multiple beginPaths and have a stroke/fill apply to all
        - beginPath will overwrite any previous paths
        - Might be marginally less performant now, but it's much cleaner
    - Fixed cracked open doors not returning to proper state when toggled
    - Change Fogofwar and shadow to seen and unseen or something much easier to understand
        - Shadow/Lights is still the same for references in code
        - Fogofwar and shadow_canvas/context is now "shroud"
            - shrouded areas are what the player has already seen
    - Temporarily disabled save/load state
    - Add menu controls, there should be a button for most things
        - Option to disable walls for a map, so everything is lit up
    - Show Entire Map detoggling doesnt show lights on Player Screen, it needs to update


Update (9/4/2019):
    - Connecting to a one way wall removes the one way data on the split
        - We need both parts of the split wall to be one way, and they would both need new points
    - One way arrows need to update with the changing walls


Update (8/29/2019):
    - Added clarification to audio search that tracks under a matching folder are included
        - Added to search input placeholder text
    - Fix the positions of the help and text_block nodes
    - Fix the UI for the Text Blocks so that it meshes more with the container header
        - Currently it looks too much like a modal that you can't move, which is misleading
    - Saving a text block should also save the map
        - This also removed all window.AppManager references from the MapListManager
    - [WONT DO] Perhaps add an interval to update the lights
    - [WONT DO] LIFX
        - Read limit values from headers
        - Being able to mash everything into one call (/states) will make it highly unlikely that I will
            run intil limit problems
    - LIFX/Lights: Have reset button to take lights back to what they were on app open
        - Batch lights together into /states call
    - Fix up checkboxes to match standard 3rem header/input size
        - Fix up the checkboxes in the map list modal, they are too easy to click outside of
        - Checkboxes are a lot better now, but not perfect.
    - Right clicking on a map tab will also remove it
    - Fix for Lights regarding lights that have zones (like the strips)
    - Map tabs need to be finished
        - Need to look more tab-ish
    - Show the map name in the save Toast when only one map is saved
    - Toast should show the actual map name if only one is being saved
        - and the number of maps saved if it was more than one
    - Leaving focus of app can at times cause it to become stuck in point moving mode
        - Hooked into mouseleave for the control canvas to shut down quick place and segment moving
        - This seems to work just fine and I havent seen anything frustrating/breaking out of it
    - Read in config
        - Master config is now passed into the app and some values are copied over
        - I can expand this if I need to, but I'm not sure I want to do the display settings anymore
    - Lights needs input in the header to enter your LIFX code
        - Currently hardcoded in the http helper
        - lifxaccess file does nothing at all
        - LIFX code should display in the header and save to the main config
        - Remove specific file for LIFX access code
    - Move everything over to github
        - Had support for Electron updating
        - Owned by Microsoft and just kinda better in general from what I can tell
    - I fucking broke the Player Screen
        - Just a bunch of broken referense in the now player_screen.js file
    - Hide Text Blocks on Player Screen
    - Look at the help text again, I don't think it's very good
    - Dimming is broken
        - It just kinda started working again, the entire flow looks good
    - Rename all instances of "display window" to "player_screen"
        - and control with "gm_screen"
    - map display.js file needs to be moved into the map container folder
        - is now "player_screen.js" along with all "display" references
    - Take another look at the store and see if it works for general use
        - It might be the best way that I can share the Audio and Lights data
        - This shit appears to just simply work, just set the data
    - Fix one way wall indicator to better show which side is see through
        - A big arrow going through the wall showing direction of light passage should work


Update (8/28/2019):
    - Cleaning up the text input modals
    - Changing the info amount buttons into an input
    - Change the style of the info buttons
    - Re-enable saving of info results
        - Change the verbage, "marked" sounds better and people won't think it saves like the map does
    - Add ability to add text to locations
        - Question Mark icon
        - Click to Open, Click outside to close
        - Should be able to save individually
            - Or at least would be nice to
    - I need a better name for this stupid app
        - GM Kit
    - Re-add/fix being able to delete tags
        - Initial tags are missing the remove button
        - Removing tags is just fucked in general
    - Lights need a way to display power status
    - HTTP helper should be added to generic helpers and have hardcoded bullshit removed
    - Lights need to update after changing


Update (8/27/2019):
    - [DONE] Figure out who made Tavern1
        - It has a very nice clean aesthetic
        - venatusmaps, marked in the map sources above
    - [NO REPRO] Adding new walls by connecting two middle walls does not split the first one
    - [WONT DO] Change file saving (shouldn't be all or nothing)


Updates (4/23/2018):
    - Arrow Key Scrolling:
        Selected window will now scroll with the arrow keys
    - Edge Hover Scrolling:
        Hover over the edge of the map to scroll in that direction
    - Secondary Window scrolling using Main Window:
        Holding 'ALT' and doing one of the above scrolling methods
        on the Main Window will scroll the Secondary Window
    - One second delay to edge hovering
        To prevent unwanted edge hovering when moving out of the map area
        the user must stay on the hover location for one second before scrolling
        will start
    - Map Dir Creation:
        If the maps directory location doesn't exist, which should be
        located next to the executable, one will now be created
    - Map Dir Location Info:
        On the map selection modal, there is no an info icon, hovering over
        this will tell you where the maps directory is located on your
        machine
    - Improved Lighting Performance on Secondary Display
    - Improved section titles on the map select modal


Updates (5/1/2018):
    - Added One Way Walls for elevation purposes
    - Added example map


Updates (5/3/2018):
    - Added a README to help showcase the application


Updates (7/9/2018):
    - Sanitize map data on save
        - Remove length for segments *not needed
            - only needed for door dragging, computed on runtime now
        - Round all segments to whole integer *floats not needed
        - Remove light links, not needed in dual map setup
    - Remove Light Links
        - They are not needed for the dual window application and are legacy
    - Whole integers for segment x/y, I can't see why rounding to the nearest whole hurts
        anything and would reduce .json file size (not important) and payload of light data
        to the secondary screen (more important)


Updates (10/5/2018)
    - Added new event/store implementation
    - Holding CTRL now lets the user drag ends of placed walls

    - Remove walls/doors there are now only segments with types
    - Fixed CTRL point deletion after refactor to more general segments
    - Fixed multiple events firing after closing and reopening map
    - Fixed opening display window clearing important segment data due to segment sanitization


Updates (1/27/2018)
    - Load DM versions of map on the DM screen if available
    - Add state saving (light and lights saving) to app
        - You can now save one state per map
    - Added map list searching

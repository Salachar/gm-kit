				<div class="section_description">GM Kit (random temporary name) is an application designed to help DMs who run games in-person with virtual enhancement (TV in table, projector, etc...). This relatively simple app lets GMs add dynamic lighting to their maps, manage local audio tracks, and hook up lights (LIFX only at the moment) and audio to create triggers for quick changes.
					<br>
					There are no enemy or player character tokens or trackers at the moment. This is app is currently best suited for those who have non-digital minis and tokens for use on top of the virtual maps.
					<br>
					There are no accounts or sign-ins required, and no information is tracked anywhere aside from a small local config.json file that the user has complete control over.
					<ul>
						<li>No maps are provided with the software, the user must supply all the maps</li>
						<li>No audio files are provided with the software, the user much supply the audio files</li>
					</ul>

			<section id="map">
				<div class="section_header">Maps: Walls and Dynamic Lighting</div>
				<div class="section_description">GM Kit works by asking for a folder of maps the first time when loading one. This will populate a modal allowing you to see which maps have walls added to them (complete) and which ones don't (image only). Walls can easily be added to the map by drawing them on whereever you want, which are then used for the dyanmic lighting on the map.
					<ul>
						<li>Walls can be added anywhere for custom dynamic lighting</li>
						<li>Doors can be added, which can be instantly opened or "dragged" open for full or partial light</li>
						<li>One Way Walls can be created that allow all light through in one direction and completely block it in another. This helps with terrain that has height variances. Block light/visibility to the top of a cliff, but allow the top of the cliff to look down over everything.</li>
						<li>GM and Player screens can be zoomed independently</li>
						<li>A custom Overlay Grid can be added for maps that don't have one or for maps where Spell/Shape markers are wanted, this grid should represent a 5' grid system, and will be saved when the map is saved.</li>
						<li>Spell/Shape Markers can be placed (line/square/circle/cone) to mark spells and see what grid squares are affected. Spell Markers are not saved to the map and will go away between closing and opening the app. (NOTE: currently requires the use of the overlay grid, as the spells use the grid to determine a 5' square for sizing)</li>
					</ul>

			<section id="audio">
				<div class="section_header">Audio: Local Track Management and Player</div>
				<div class="section_description">By pointing the app to a local folder of audio tracks, they will all become available to play and manage. Tracks can be searched by name or folder, and can be tagged for easier searching as well. Tracks can hold any number of tags, though the UI may not like it at the moment. Tracks simply loop when ended (unless looping has been turned off). Previously played tracks are saved to help when switcing between tracks</div>

			<section id="info">
				<div class="section_header">Info: Random Name and Quest Generators</div>
				<div class="section_description">Several small generators to help with coming up with names and places on the spot. Names are split between races and gender and any number can be generated at a time. Clicking on a result will mark it to remain in the list during the current app session</div>
				<div class="section_images"></div>
			</section>

			<section id="lights">
				<div class="section_header">Lights: LIFX Light Control</div>
				<div class="section_description">By inputting your unique LIFX Access Code,you can have limited control over your smart lights. Currently, only individual lights can be turned on/off or scenes can be activated. (NOTE: Your LIFX Access Code will not be sent anywhere, and is only saved to a local config.json file on your computer.</div>
				<div class="section_images"></div>
			</section>

			<section id="triggers">
				<div class="section_header">Triggers: Audio and Light Combinations</div>
				<div class="section_description">IN PROGRESS. Audio tracks and lights will be able to be combined to form a "trigger". Triggers can be activated by activating it on the Triggers page or by placing it on a map for easy use. Triggers with only audio tracks will be allowed for those who don't have or want to use their smart bulbs. These triggers can be used to easily switch between different scenarios, such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Blue lighting and rain track: Instantly switch to rainy scenario</li>
						<li>Red/Orange lighting and combat track: Instant switch into combat</li>
					</ul>
